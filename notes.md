- undirected cyclical graph
- rooms are nodes connected by edges
- need a dictionary to track which nodes have been visited and how they're connected
- do a DFT to traverse graph to unvisited nodes
    - pick random unexplored direction from players' current room
    - update visited dictionary, noting adjacencies/edges
    - when you reach a dead end, or all nodes around you have been visited, 
        - perform a BFS of the dictionary to find closest node with an unexplored exit
        - steer player back to that node and repeate DFT
